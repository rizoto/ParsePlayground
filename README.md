ParsePlayground
===============

A simple app to gain experience using Parse as a backend. Allows users to sign in using email, facebook, twitter, or as an anonymous user. Users can complete a small profile form, view other users, take and upload images, and view other users' images. It doesn't look pretty, but that isn't the purpose of this one.
